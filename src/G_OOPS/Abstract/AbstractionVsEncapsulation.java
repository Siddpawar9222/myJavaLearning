**Abstraction**:


In other words, abstraction hides the unnecessary details and shows only the essential features of an object. It provides a clear separation between the interface (how the object can be used) and the implementation (how the object accomplishes its functionality).

For example, think of a remote control for a TV. You don't need to know how the remote control sends signals to the TV or how the TV processes those signals. All you need to know are the buttons and functions available on the remote control to interact with the TV.

**Encapsulation**:

Encapsulation helps prevent unauthorized access and modification of an object's internal state. By providing well-defined methods to manipulate the data, you can ensure that the data remains in a consistent and valid state.

Continuing with the TV remote control analogy, encapsulation would involve hiding the internal electronics and wiring of the remote control and only providing buttons that users can press to control the TV.

**Key Differences**:

1. **Focus**:
   - Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and relevant view of an object's functionality.
   - Encapsulation focuses on controlling access to an object's internal state and exposing a controlled interface.

2. **Purpose**:
   - Abstraction helps manage complexity by creating high-level models of objects.
   - Encapsulation helps ensure data integrity and security by controlling access to data and methods.

3. **Relationship**:
   - Abstraction is often used in conjunction with inheritance to create class hierarchies.
   - Encapsulation is closely related to information hiding and data protection.

In summary, abstraction deals with presenting only relevant information, while encapsulation deals with controlling access to that information. Both concepts contribute to creating well-designed, modular, and maintainable code.
