/*
Anonymous inner class: 
- It is an inner class without a name and for which only a single object is created . class without name .
- An anonymous inner class can be useful when making an instance of an object with certain "extras" such as overloading methods of a class or interface, without having to actually subclass a class.
-inner class can be created in two ways:
    Class (may be abstract or concrete).    
	Interface
