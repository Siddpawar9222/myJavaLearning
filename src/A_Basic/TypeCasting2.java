  Note : 
  Decimal value(fractional number) : e.g. 1205.56
  Whole number value : e.g. 45451 ,-62542
  
  Rules : 
  
  1]Decimal literals without any suffix are treated as double by default. For example, 10.10 is treated as a double.

  2]Whole number literals (without any decimal point) are treated as integers by default. For example, 10 is treated as an int.
  
  3] Types of typecasting : 
     A] Implicit(Default) :
        Done by java automatically 
        conversion of smaller value to larger value
        e.g. int to long , float to double etc
     
    B] Explicit typecasting : 
         Developer has to do 
         conversion of larger value to smaller value
         e.g.. long to int , double to float etc


  4]In Java, when you perform operations (like addition, subtraction,  multiplication, or division) between same numeric types, the  result is we get also of same numeric types.
  
  5]
  In Java, when you perform operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) between different numeric types, the result is automatically promoted to the widest data type involved in the operation.
  
  e.g..
  float a = (float)10.10 ;
  int b = 10 ; 
  
  In this case:
  
     a is a float.
     b is an int.
  The wider type here is float because it can accommodate both integer and floating-point values. So, during the division operation, Java automatically promotes b to a float before performing the division. This means that the division operation is essentially between two float values (a and the promoted b).

    float c = a/b ;
  if c would have defined double , it would have been worked , beacuse double is biggger than float , and it would work . (Rule 3)

  6]Hence to get correct result when you divide same numeric types value (like Integer to Integer) ,you have cast one of the integers to a float or a double, like this: (float)10/20 or 10.0/20 . Now in expression widest datatype would be here float or double. 
  

  //* -- >
    (float)7/2 * 16/5 ==> 3.5 * 16/5 ==> 56.00/5 (According to Rule 5 ) ==> 11.2
